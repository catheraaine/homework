<!--
Create several divs of various widths, heights, and colors. Use margins to push them around the page.

Make some of the DIV's links (anchors), and make the background color change on mouse over. Fun!

Try to position some of the DIV's relative-ly in a vertical line down the middle of the page

Create a class that you can use with <span> tags to make whatever text is selected 2x the size it would normally be (think %). Remember King Jong Un?

Extra credit: Read about Absolute positions in the Class 4 Presentation.
Extra credit: Use images as links and change them on mouse over.
