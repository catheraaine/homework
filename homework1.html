		<!-- Description -->
		<p>
			Hello. I'm going to tell you about Sir Patrick Stewart, and why he is one of my favorite people.
		</p> 
		<p>
			First off, Patrick is in a ton of movies and television shows. He is most famous for playing Captain Jean Luc Picard in <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em>, as well as the older Professor Charles Xavier ("Professor X") in the current iteration of <em>X-Men</em>. However, he also played King Richard in <em>Robin Hood: Men in Tights</em>, Claudius in <em>Hamlet</em> (twice, actually!), and has voice acted in many video games and cartoons, including <em>The Simpsons</em>, <em>The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim</em>, and <em>The Pagemaster</em>. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Secondly, he is a knight. As in, an actual, honest-to-God, kneeling-in-front-of-the-Queen, Knight. His title is "Sir". Eight hundred years ago he would wield a sword and carry out the King's justice. Now he probably goes to fancy parties just for other knights. How cool is that?
		</p>
		<p>
			Finally, Patrick is best friends with Gandalf. Okay, not <em>actual</em> Gandalf, but the guy who plays him, Sir Ian McKellan. Yep, two knights that are besties. They are constantly tweeting pictures of their adventures together. Wearing bowler hats. If you click <a href="https://twitter.com/SirPatStew/status/447491370455158784" target="_blank">here</a>, you can see for yourself.

		<!-- List of favorite things-->
		<h3>My Favorite things about Patrick Stewart:</h3>
		<ul class="list">
			<li>He's a <a href="http://weknowmemes.com/generator/uploads/generated/g1367279965748383382.jpg" target="_blank">meme</a> (NSFW?).</li>
			<li>Actually, he's two <a href="http://www.avatarhosting.net/pics/12721/picardfacepalm.jpg" target="_blank">memes</a>.</li>
			<li>He's been on <em>The Simpsons, Futurama, Robot Chicken, American Dad, Family Guy,</em> and <em>The Colbert Report</em>. That's probably some kind of record for stupid television guest spots.</li>
			<li>He's a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company. You know, the one founded by Shakespeare?</li>
			<li>Growing up watching ST:TNG, and without a "dad", Captain Picard was the best father figure. Way better than that Kirk guy.</li>
			<li>He's bald, but in a good way.</li>
			<li>There is just too much to list.</li>
